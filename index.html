        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet;
            you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia,
            and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our
            record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending
            on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable
            as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact
            walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.

            Our amazing clients are the reason we exist,
            and their reactions to our customized travel
            experiences and personalized service keep us
            smiling all day long. Here is just a sampling of
            what they’ve said:

            She has booked two major European trips for us
            in the past year and every aspect has met, and
            in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best
            prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and best
            cruises, she does it all. But the most important
            thing is she remembers the little things that we
            would do if we were making the plans ourselves.

            Leigh McAdam has been making my travel
            arrangements for about 20 years and there is no
            one else I would trust to arrange my trips and
            tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the
            group trips she has arranged - Peru &amp; Machu
            Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and
            diving. It's always an eclectic group of well
            traveled, interesting people.
