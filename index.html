                jumping.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet;
            you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia,
            and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our
            record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending
            on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable
            as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact
            walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.
